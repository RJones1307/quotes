# Quotes Generator — rjones1307

Small web app that fetches random quotes from the public Quotable API and lets users save favorites to localStorage. Includes a fallback set of quotes if the API can't be reached.

How to run locally
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no server required).
3. Or run a simple local server:
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Then open `http://localhost:8000`

Deploy with GitHub Pages
1. Create a repository on GitHub (e.g., `quotes-generator`).
2. Push these files to the repository.
3. In the repo Settings → Pages, choose the branch (main) and root folder (`/`) then Save.
4. The site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` within a few minutes.

Linking from your portfolio
- Add a project card to your portfolio `index.html` linking to the live demo URL and your repo:

If you want, I can:
- Create a GitHub repo for you (rjones1307/quotes-generator) and push these files.

Which do you prefer? If you'd like me to create the repo, reply "Create repo" and confirm:
- The repo name (default: `quotes-generator`)
- Whether it should be public or private (public recommended for demos)
- Any display name/email to add in README or index.html (optional)
